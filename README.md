# Part 1 
## Library uses :
--> pip install csv
--> pip install math
--> pip install numpy
--> pip install networkx
--> pip install matplotlib
--> pip install pathlib


### Display graph and solution on connected network
We had to extract from the [image](map_gotham_metro.jpg) of the gotham metro network the position of the stations and display a graph with the different connections.
We put by **hand** the information in a [csv file](Station.csv) in order to store the information.
(The coordinates are in Pixels.)

The display of the graphs and solution can be seen in [this file MetroGRaph.py](MetroGraph.py)

#### 1-2-Which kind of algorithm create a connected graph while minimizing the total amount of distance? Show the algorithm? What is its complexity?
The algorith we are going to use is **Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree**.
It has a complexity of **O(|V|^2)** ( V = vertices).


# Part 2 

## Library uses :
--> pip install numpy
--> pip install networkx
--> pip install matplotlib


### 2-1 Which kind of algorithm create a connected graph while minimizing the distance to a unique city ? What is its complexit?
The algorith we are going to use is **Dijkstra's algorithm ( Dijkstra's Shortest Path First algorithm)**.
It has a complexity of **O((|E|+|V|)*log(|V|))** ( V = vertices and E = edges).

### 2-1 Show and display a solution of the proposed algorithm.
We had to use the matrice given by the subject to run dijktra's algorithm. Dijktra's algorithm use 2 methods, one is for return the minimum distance between some edges and the other is for create a figure to display the distance between 2 town.
Finaly Dijktra's algorithm take a matrice of connetion and return 2 figures. One is to display all the distance between Gotham and the pther town and the second figure is to display the graph of connection (usefull for the next question).
Note: It's important to notify that in the graph the value written in the node begin to 0. Because of that Gotham which is define as g0 in the topic appears at node 0 in the figure. Same for g1 appears at node 1 etc....

### 2-3 Show and display a solution of the problem
As we can see with the figure 1 generated by the Dijktra's algorithm there are 7 leaf on the graph. So we can say, it's necessary to send 7 volunteers. 
Note : We can see in the matrix given in the topic that go to city G4 directly from G1 or from G1 then G9, this is the same distance value (7,7). But the algorithm return the path G1-G9-G4 because it's better in term of volunteers number.
(The algorithmfirst check directly connection from G1 to the other and after it check undirectly connection in that way if undirect connection have the same distance it take the undirect connection to minimize the number of volunteers.)

# Part 3
## Library uses :
--> pip install csv
--> pip install pathlib

### 3-1 Suggest and show a greedy method to findan ID in a (linear) database. What is its complexity ?
We used an algorithm that scans the entire dataset to find the ID (it stops as soon as it finds it).
It has a complexity of **O(n)**
The database is call DatasetPart3.csv (ID,Name,IDofconfirmed). It store the ID and the name of the member and the Id of the member that certified this member.
Note : In this dataset the Id is already sort (Automaticaly sorted when we have created the CSV file), but methode FindID also work for unsorted CSV.

### 3-2 Suggest and showa divide and conquer method to find an ID in a (linear) database. What is its complexity ?
Because for the moment we use a sorted database we decided to use the method of a dichotomic search algorithm.
It has a complexity of **O(log(n))**
Note : Both research algorithm research the ID of a member in the dataset. If it is, the algorithm display in the console a message that the ID is in the Dataset and the name of the member and also the name of the member that certified him.

### 3-3 Suggest and show a method that sort the (linear) database and find an ID. What is its complexity ?
First we decided to modify the Database name DatasetPart3.csv to create the Database name DatasetPart3NotSort.csv where we had just modify the order of the element to unsorted the ID. In that way we can apply the sort method.
We decide to use the sort algorithm merge sort. 
It has a complexity of **O(nlog(n))**

### 3-4 Show and display the three methods with an example of database of your choice (at least 50 data)
We decided to use the unsorted database ( DatasetPart3NotSort.csv).
Fisrt the main launch the FindID method (Question 3-1), which display the research of the ID number 10.
Second it launch the sort method (in order to apply the dichotomic search after).
Third it launch the dichotomic search algorithm for the ID number 12.
All the ID number could be change in the main.
