# Part 1 
### Display graph and solution on connected network
We had to extract from the [image](map_gotham_metro.jpg) of the gotham metro network the position of the stations and display a graph with the different connections.
We put by hand the information in a [csv file](Station.csv) in order to store the information.
(The coordinates are in Pixels.)

The display of the graphs and solution can be seen in [this file MetroGRaph.py](MetroGraph.py)
